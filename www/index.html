        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

				<p>Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point.

But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. </p>
